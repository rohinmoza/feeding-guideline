# Heart Center Infant Feeding Guideline

A mobile-optimized clinical reference for enteral nutrition advancement in postoperative and non-surgical infants with complex congenital heart disease.

## Overview

This guideline standardizes enteral feeding initiation, advancement, and intolerance management for high-risk infants in the cardiac ICU. It was developed through a multidisciplinary Heart Center QI initiative involving physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, dietitians, and pharmacists.

## Target Population

**Infants < 90 days** meeting ≥ 1 of the following:
- Single ventricle physiology
- LVOT obstruction
- Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt / PDA stent
- Large unrepaired PDA
- Truncus arteriosus / AP window
- MAPCAs
- Weight < 2.5 kg

**Excluded:** sVAD, prematurity < 36 weeks GA, recurrent hematochezia

## What's Included

- **Advancement pathway** — Stepwise enteral volume and caloric density progression from trophic feeds to goal (150 mL/kg/day, 24 kcal/oz)
- **EN/PN volume summary table** — Combined caloric delivery at each step
- **Feeding intolerance management** — Cause-specific interventions for vomiting, distention, pain, diarrhea, constipation, and hematochezia
- **Initiation criteria** — Five readiness-to-feed criteria for the ICU
- **Vitals monitoring thresholds** — HR, RR, and NIRS parameters to assess with any feed modification
